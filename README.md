My own vision of an old game - Minesweeper

<h1>
 Why minesweeper?
</h1>
It was made for trainig purposes and I also love this game - its amazing how such a simple idea can bring so much fun into our lives. I had a lot of fun making it, although it is far from finished - the system which is supposed to reveal blank squares doesn't work and it is a pretty major inconvenience. DISCONTINUED LONG AGO, but might come back to it in the future :)

<h2>4 Diffrent Levels</h2>

 1. Beginner ( 8 x 8 with 10 mines )
 3. Normal ( 16 x 16 with 40 mines )
 4. Hard ( 30 x 16 with 99 mines )
 5. Impossible ( 30 x 24 with 200 mines )
